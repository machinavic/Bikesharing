# Unit 15: Tableau_ Citibike NYC #

## Overview ##
In order to present a realistic and convincent business idea to the investors related to the Bike-Sharing program in Des Moines in NYC, data from August 2019 were taken from the Citi Bike System Data page because the llikelihood for more traffic bikes would be during summer months. Later on, the Trip Duration column on this csv file was modified from an Integer data type into a Datetime to make the study more realistic, and it was saved into the GitHub repo with the "citibike.csv" file name.

To carry out this study, the statistical analysis was presented using Tableau software with the aim to express a clear and fair idea to the shareholders. Clear words = Satisfied customers.

Different models were made using Tableau such as "Worksheets" to make graphs and plots, "Dashboards" to accommodate all the results gven in the worksheets, and later visualize them into the "Story". For this reason, the study was divided into sections as it shows right here:

1.Worksheets
    1.1-Number of Rides.
    1.2-Quantity of Customers.
    1.3-August Peak Hours.
    1.4-Top Starting Locations.
    1.5-Top Ending Locations.
    1.6-Gender Breakdown.
    1.7-Average Trip Duration.
    1.8-Bike Repairs.
    1.9-Bike Utilization.
    1.10-Checkout Times for Users.
    1.11-Checkout Times for Gender.
    1.12-Trips by Weekday per Hour.
    1.13-Trips by Gender.
    1.14-User Trips by Gender by Weekdays.

2.Dashboards
    2.1-Overview.
    2.2-Checkout Times for Users.
    2.3-Checkout Times for Gender.
    2.4-Trips by Weekday per Hour.
    2.5-Trips by Gender.
    2.6-User Trips by Gender by Weekdays.

3.Story "NYC Citi Bike"

All data appears depicted in the two (2) Tableau files, one of them is "bike citi NYC", and the other one is the Deliverable 2 where the final Story is presented. All of this files will push to the GitHub repository. Some images depicting the results gotten will be shown in the "Results" section here below.

## Results ##

Results are better shown when we take into account the summary made using the dashboards.
As it can be seen in the first dashboard named "Overview", the number of trips made in August are about 2,344,224 rides, all of them concentrated in Manhattan city. Out of this number, 443,865 are customers and the remaining amount belong to suscribers, meaning the 81% of the population is suscribed to this service but use to not ride during this month. On the other hand, 65% of this riding population are men.

Going into Checkout times by Users and Gender, the graph shows almost none users ride bikes for more than 5 minutes, and none of them overpass the first hour of travel. However, exactly at this time there are 3 times more men riding bikes than women in the city of New York.

As well, checking the heatmaps for "Trips by Weekday per Hour" and  "Trips by Gender", it looks like the trips occur in the morning around from 6:00am to 9:00am, and in the afternoon between 4:00pm and 8:00pm. Heavy trips occur also during weekends on Saturday during all day almost, and from 10:00am to 5:00pm on Sundays. This research denotes people ride bikes mainly as a mode of transportation to go to work, and to work out on weekends.

## Summary ##

As an abstract for this analysis, the story made in Tableau will be helpful to accomplish this task.
That being said, we can say the NY city had in the month of August 2019, 2 344 224 bike rides, most of them were made byt the suscriber to this service and men were the most who rides throught the city of Manhattan. The trip duration in this analysis didn't overpass the 5 minutes pedaling, and as seen in the graph, men are the higher quantity in this situation compared with the women at the same time. All of this analysis indicate the bicycle is a mode of transportation for the population in the Manhattan city and they are used mainly to commute to work because the higher density in riding are in the morning and late in the afternoon during weekdays.

This topic entails to do another analysis taking in consideration the granularity of this study because you can go more in depth let's say t ocheck how many males/females there are into the suscriber population.

All of this can be seen into this Tableau file:
